# GAN_MNIST PyTorch
Implementing GAN on MNIST Dataset in PyTorch

This project is to implement generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The trained model will be able
to generate hand written digit images.

All the step and detailed explanation is included in notebook file (MNIST_GAN_Exercise.ipynb).

User can change and tune the model as per the requirements. Once all the cells in notebook are executed, a PyTorch model will be created.

**May be notebook does not open in github file viewer. A separate markdown file is provied for online view**
